# Analysis of Contributing Factors for the Success of Speed-Dating

The project is focused on using classification algorithms to find the contributing factors of speed dating that will lead to a second date. We are also interested in seeing if those factors differ based on the participant’s gender and race. The data we use is compiled by Columbia Business School professors Ray Fisman and Sheena Iyengar for their paper “Gender Differences in Mate Selection: Evidence From a Speed Dating Experiment.” We first conducted data exploration and cleaning on the original data set. Then we completed the feature engineering to reconstruct it into a dataset containing 7 important features that might have an important influence on the result. After applying Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and XGBoosting, we selected the Decision Tree model as our preferred model due to its best performance and concluded the top 3 most influential factors that contribute to speed-dating success.
