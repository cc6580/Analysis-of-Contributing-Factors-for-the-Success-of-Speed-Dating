# Analysis of Contributing Factors for the Success of Speed-Dating

The project is focused on using classication algorithms to find the contributing factors of speed dating that will lead to a second date. We are also interested in seeing if those factors differ based on the participant’s gender and race. The data we use is compiled by Columbia Business School professors Ray Fisman and Sheena Iyengar for their paper “Gender Differences in Mate Selection: Evidence From a Speed Dating Experiment.” We first conducted data exploration and cleaning on the original data set. Then we completed the feature engineering to re-construct it into a dataset containing 7 important features that might have important influcence on the result. After applying Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and XGBoosting, we selected the Decision Tree model as our preferred model due to its best performance. The conclusion is that the 3 most influential contributing factors of speed dating success are rating, financial difference and experience difference.
